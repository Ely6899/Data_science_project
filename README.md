# Data_science_project (Ely Kozinets, Idan Yanai)
Semester 1:
In this repository, there are 3 folders, 2 of those are Individual task folders, each dedicated to a seperate student.
The 'Project' folder contains 2 jupyter notebooks of the project. The mushroom file is a kaggle project, and the car price file is the main project. The data was gathered from data.gov.il.
The dictionary file is a file dedicated to simplifing the data on the mushroom project. It has no use in the car price project.
There are also seperate branches, but they were used for simultanious work on the project. 
All the project final products are in the master branch!!!
